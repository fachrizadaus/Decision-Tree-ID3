### About the Algorithm

The ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm is a popular decision tree algorithm used in machine learning. It aims to build a decision tree by iteratively selecting the best attribute to split the data based on information gain. Each node represents a test on an attribute, and each branch represents a possible outcome of the test.
